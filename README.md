# KATA SKELETON DAN THE DEV - PYTHON VERSION

## How to use the template

Create your own repository starting from the template here on GitHub - give a name meaningful for the Kata exercise.
The only requirement on your computer are: 
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Then, clone it and simply run tests using the command `make install` from your terminal, in the root folder of the project.

From now on, you can start with the Kata. 
I suggest you refactor names at first: for example, for `FizzBuzz` kata, I renamed the `Main.py` to `FizzBuzz.py` and `Main_test.py` to `FizzBuzz_test`.
